Sanitized and reduced version of my final project at Johnson County Community College.

This repository contains the code that was written by me. It does not contain the entire project.

This is a database driven web-app meant to aid in the coordination of a small fleet of vehicles. It allows users
to create and manage reservations for different vehicles.

This project was created for Johnson County Developmental Supports.
